== Introduction

Seed is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of a discrete unit of work contained within a Docker
image. While initially developed to support the http://ngageoint.github.io/scale/[Scale] data processing system with job
discovery, it is designed to be readily applied to other systems as well.

Seed compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-seed` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or
Registry push. This requirement will be deprecated as label search support is standardized across Docker registry
services. Use of the http://github.com/ngageoint/seed-cli[CLI] developed by the Seed team is highly recommended to speed
the development and packaging of jobs according to the Seed specification.

=== Format

The Docker image created must adhere to a specific naming convention. The standard requires specification of both an
job and a packaging version, tracking changes individually between the job logic and the packaging of it.
The following image naming template maps to members defined under the <<job-section>>:

----
<name>-<jobVersion>-seed:<packageVersion>
----

Dockerfile snippet containing required label for Seed compliance:

----

The `com.ngageoint.seed.manifest` label contents must be serialized as a string-escaped JSON object. The following is a
complete example including required and optional keys:
