The Seed standard is intended to provide a complete definition of the runtime processing, memory and storage
requirements of a discrete unit of work, in addition to the inputs, outputs and potential errors produced.
Completeness is fundamental but the standard accommodates both simple and complex jobs by defining a minimal subset of
REQUIRED properties. The following sections detail every possible REQUIRED and OPTIONAL manifest property in both root
and child objects.

A complete Seed object contained within a `com.ngageoint.seed.manifest` label is always a string-escaped serialized
object. In Seed, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs -- also called members. For each member, the
name is always a string. Member values are either a string, number, object, array or one of the literals: true, false,
and null. An array consists of elements where each element is a value as described above.

[[seed-section, Seed Object]]
=== Seed Object
The Seed object is the root JSON object that MUST be placed within a `com.ngageoint.seed.manifest` Docker image label.
At a minimum this object MUST define the `seedVersion` and `job` names.

[[resources-section, Resources Object]]
===== Resources Object
The Resources object is the member that identifies all resource requirements for a job. This is most commonly CPU,
memory and disk scalar resources, but MAY in the future accommodate more complex types such as ranges and sets. The
final computed resources allocated for all `scalar` elements MUST be injected as environment variables to the job at run
time. Reference <<environment-variables>> and <<resource-defaults>> for clarification on what the implementing framework
MUST provide.

[cols="2,2,1,5",options="header"]
|=====
| Name | Requirement 2+| Value

|`scalar`
|Required
2+|MUST be an array of `Scalar` objects and MAY contain any number of elements. There is no other standard restriction
on the array size.
|=====

.Scalar Object
The Scalar objects MAY include any arbitrary custom resource name, but there are reserved resources `cpus`, `disk`,
`mem` and `sharedMem` that have special meaning. The reserved resource names `cpus`, `disk` and `mem` SHOULD be
populated by all Seed compliant images, as the defaults provided at runtime will likely be inadequate to run all but the
most minimal job. The `sharedMem` resource applies primarily to high-performance and scientific applications
and will rarely be needed.

[cols="2,2,1,5",options="header"]
|=====
| Name | Requirement 2+| Value

|`name`
|Required
2+|MUST be a string of only alphabetic, dash or underscore characters (defined by the regex† `^[a-zA-Z_-]+$`) indicating
the resource required by the job. Refer to <<variable-injection>> for details on environment variable available at
execution time.

|`value`
|Required
2+|MUST be a number indicating the quantity of the resource required by the job. When dealing with storage resources
such as `mem` or `disk` units of Mebibytes (MiB) MUST be used.

|`inputMultiplier`
|Optional
2+|MUST be a number indicating the factor by which input file size is multiplied and added to the constant value
for resource.
|=====

Use of `inputMultiplier` for `mem` or `disk` resource types is useful when memory or output disk requirements of a job
are a function of input file size. The following basic formula computes the resource requirement when an
`inputMultiplier` is defined.

----
resourceRequirement = inputVolume * inputMultiplier + constantValue
----

For example, when total input file size is 2.0MiB and an `inputMultiplier` of `4.0` and `value` of `0.1` is
specified for `disk`, the following computes the resource requirement:

----
diskRequirement = 2.0MiB * 4.0 + 0.1MiB

[[interface-section, Interface Object]]
===== Interface Object
The Interface object is the primary member that describes the command arguments, environment variables,
mounts, settings, inputs and outputs defined for a job.

[cols="2,2,1,5",options="header"]
|=====
| Name | Requirement 2+| Value

|`command`
|Optional
2+|MUST be a string specifying the complete string passed to the container at run time. Based on the Linux shell, shell
escaping of special characters MAY be required. If a Docker ENTRYPOINT is defined that launches the executable, omission
of the executable MAY be necessary in `command` string. The Seed `command` member can be treated as analogous to the
Docker CMD statement.

|`inputs`
|Optional
2+|MUST be an object as defined in <<inputs-section>>.

|`outputs`
|Optional
2+|MUST be an object as defined in <<outputs-section>>.

absolute path to a single file.

|`partial`
|Optional
2+|MUST be a boolean indicating whether input file is required in whole or in part. This allows an executor† to make
intelligent choices when providing very large files to a job. This should only be set to true if the job is expected to
use less than half of very large input files. If omitted, the default value MUST be treated as false.

|`required`

[[outputs-section, Outputs Object]]
====== Outputs Object
The Outputs object is the member responsible for indicating all output data and the means to capture that data
following the execution of a Seed image. Data can be captured in two different forms: directly as a file or
extracted JSON from a manifest. File type output is simply matched based on a standard glob pattern. Recursively scanning
directories is NOT supported, but a known subdirectory structure will work (e.g. base/sub-*/*.ext).  JSON objects are
expected to be gathered from a JSON manifest that by Seed standard convention MUST be written at the root of the job
output directory as `seed.outputs.json`. The absolute path to the job output directory is REQUIRED to be passed
into the container at job execution time in the `OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable. Special attention should be given to
<<output-data-capture,output file permissions>> and support is provided for defining
<<extended-file-metadata,extended metadata>>.

While it is _highly_ advised that Seed jobs SHOULD limit input / output to the provided constructs (`inputs` /
