.SH "NAME"
seed standard definition \- A general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of a discrete unit of work contained within a Docker image.
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.sp
Seed is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of a discrete unit of work contained within a Docker
image. While initially developed to support the \c
.URL "http://ngageoint.github.io/scale/" "Scale" " "
data processing system with job
discovery, it is designed to be readily applied to other systems as well.
.sp
Seed compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix \f[CR]\-seed\fP must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or
Registry push. This requirement will be deprecated as label search support is standardized across Docker registry
services. Use of the \c
.URL "http://github.com/ngageoint/seed\-cli" "CLI" " "
developed by the Seed team is highly recommended to speed
the development and packaging of jobs according to the Seed specification.
.SS "Format"
.sp
The Docker image created must adhere to a specific naming convention. The standard requires specification of both an
job and a packaging version, tracking changes individually between the job logic and the packaging of it.
The following image naming template maps to members defined under the Job Objects:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<name>\-<jobVersion>\-seed:<packageVersion>
.fi
.if n \{\

Dockerfile snippet containing required label for Seed compliance:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf

LABEL com.ngageoint.seed.manifest="{\(rs"seedVersion\(rs":\(rs"1.0.0\-snapshot\(rs",\(rs"job\(rs":{ ... }}"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \f[CR]com.ngageoint.seed.manifest\fP label contents must be serialized as a string\-escaped JSON object. The following is a
complete example including required and optional keys:

.SH "STANDARD"
.sp
The Seed standard is intended to provide a complete definition of the runtime processing, memory and storage
requirements of a discrete unit of work, in addition to the inputs, outputs and potential errors produced.
Completeness is fundamental but the standard accommodates both simple and complex jobs by defining a minimal subset of
REQUIRED properties. The following sections detail every possible REQUIRED and OPTIONAL manifest property in both root
and child objects.
.sp
A complete Seed object contained within a \f[CR]com.ngageoint.seed.manifest\fP label is always a string\-escaped serialized
object. In Seed, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs \(em; also called members. For each member, the
name is always a string. Member values are either a string, number, object, array or one of the literals: true, false,
and null. An array consists of elements where each element is a value as described above.
.SS "Seed Object"
.sp
The Seed object is the root JSON object that MUST be placed within a \f[CR]com.ngageoint.seed.manifest\fP Docker image label.

The Outputs object is the member responsible for indicating all output data and the means to capture that data
following the execution of a Seed image. Data can be captured in two different forms: directly as a file or
extracted JSON from a manifest. File type output is simply matched based on a standard glob pattern. Recursively scanning
directories is NOT supported, but a known subdirectory structure will work (e.g. base/sub\-\fB/\fP.ext).  JSON objects are
expected to be gathered from a JSON manifest that by Seed standard convention MUST be written at the root of the job
output directory as \f[CR]seed.outputs.json\fP. The absolute path to the job output directory is REQUIRED to be passed

Supporting complex variable expansion where jobs require parameters associated with a switch can be accomplished with

\f[CR]${MY_INPUT/#/\-d }\fP

is important to note this is specifically a Bash shell feature and is not present with competing Linux shells.
.SS "Output Data Capture"
.sp
All output data generated by a Seed compliant job MUST be placed within the location identified by OUTPUT_DIR
environment variable. This location MUST be made available by the executor† so that the job is given full write
access. Developers MUST ensure any files captured by \f[CR]interface.outputs.files\fP member element \f[CR]pattern\fP values, as well
as the optional \f[CR]seed.outputs.json\fP file, are marked with read permissions at minimum. This MAY be done with the
following sample command: \f[CR]chmod +r yourfile.txt\fP
.sp
Special attention should also be given to the number of files matched per \f[CR]interface.outputs.files\fP element to ensure it
is consistent in plurality to that defined by \f[CR]multiple\fP member. If multiple files are matched using the \f[CR]pattern\fP
member value, while the \f[CR]multiple\fP member is set to false, these jobs SHOULD be failed by the executor†. On the other
hand, even if multiple files are not present when \f[CR]multiple\fP is true it SHOULD NOT force a job failure by the executor†.
.SS "Extended File Metadata"
.sp
There is often a need by the executor† to capture additional job extracted metadata on output files. The Seed
standard allows for this through the use of side\-car files. The side\-car files must be named exactly as the file they
describe, with the addition of the \f[CR].metadata.json\fP extension to the original file name (extension included). The file
must be formatted according to the Seed Metadata Schema. This allows for both
spatial and any custom associated metadata to be specified. The \f[CR]properties\fP member is of the object type which allows
for any JSON member type that satisfies your specific use\-cases.

.SS "Resource Defaults"
.sp
At a minimum, the executor† MUST provide at least the resources indicated by a Seed manifest at run time. If the
resource requirement specified by the manifest is below the minimum amount allowed by the executor† it MAY increase the
requirement to that value. Developers† SHOULD specify the \f[CR]cpus\fP, \f[CR]mem\fP and \f[CR]disk\fP requirements of their Seed job, but
if these are not set, the executor† is free to allocate minimal defaults.

.SH "DISCOVERY"
.sp
A primary intention of this standard is for simple job discovery from public images hosted within either Docker Hub,
Docker Trusted Registry or Docker Registry. There is significant fragmentation of APIs between the various Docker
offerings and the following sections describe the steps that may be taken to access the labels defined by Seed.
.sp
None of the Docker registry services support label search in any fashion. This incurs the requirement of applying a
secondary means to subset image results. The standard presently requires that all job images are named with the suffix
\f[CR]\-seed\fP. This allows for quick filtering of results to a manageable set for discovery.
.SS "Docker Hub"
.sp
Docker Hub stores Docker image manifest information in a readily accessible format only for Automated Builds. This
enforces the need for all developers† wishing to support simple discovery from Docker Hub to support Hub builds, as
opposed to local image builds followed by a docker push. Given this caveat, a service such as ImageLayers can be used
to quickly identify manifest content after discovering available images.
.sp
The following two steps may be taken to find and identify labels within Docker Hub:
.sp

The ImageLayers service is a 3rd\-party service by CenturyLink Labs, but the source code is openly available at

.SS "Docker Registry"
.sp
Docker Registry does not natively support any type of search, but does provide a catalog API that allows for listing the
entire registry contents. Using this along with tag and manifest inspection will allow label inspection.

The following steps may be taken to find and identify labels of Seed compliant images within Docker Registry:

.SS "Docker Trusted Registry"
.sp
There is a ticket in with Docker Trusted Registry team to natively support label search. Presently there is no API
support to inspect hosted images for label metadata. Images must be pulled locally for inspection.
.SS "Silo"
.sp
The Seed team has developed a tool to overcome these limitations in Docker registries called \c
.URL "https://github.com/ngageoint/seed\-silo" "Silo" "."
.sp
Silo offers a REST API, implemented by the Seed team, for discovering Seed images. The API
allows users to scan one or more repositories for Seed images and then search the resulting images and their manifests
by keywords. An executor† can leverage these endpoints to assist users in discovering Seed images and creating
jobs out of them.
