== Introduction

Seed is a general standard to aid in the discovery and consumption of
discrete units of work contained within a Docker image. While initially developed to support the
http://ngageoint.github.io/scale/[Scale] data processing system with job discovery, it is designed to be readily
applied to other systems as well.

Seed compliant images must be named in a specific fashion due to the lack of label search capability on Docker Hub
and Registry services. The suffix `-seed` must be used when naming images to enable discovery, prior to Hub or
Registry push. This requirement will be deprecated as label search support is standardized across Docker registry
services.

=== Format

Dockerfile snippet containing required label for Seed compliance:

----
include::examples/complete/Dockerfile[]
----

The com.seed.manifest label contents must be serialized as a string-escaped JSON object. The following is a complete
example including required and optional keys:

== Usage

=== Implementing
A few requirements must be satisfied when implementing a system capable of executing Seed standardized images.

==== Environment Variables
Environment variable injection must be performed. These may be consumed by job directly as environment variables or
shell variable expansion may be leveraged in the `interface.args` member.

The following minimum variables MUST be provided:

* JOB_OUTPUT_DIR: Root path all output products must be placed by job for processing system capture.
* ALLOCATED_CPUS: Value of `cpus` member.
* ALLOCATED_MEM: Value of `mem` member.
* ALLOCATED_SHARED_MEM: Value of `shared_mem` member.
* ALLOCATED_STORAGE: Value of `storage` member.
* All `name` member values of `interface.inputData.files` elements MUST map to environment variables. Name case MUST map
exactly from `name` value. It is the processing framework's responsibility to ensure data is mounted and to ensure the
path is container resolvable.
* All `name` member values of `interface.inputData.json` elements MUST map to environment variables. Name case MUST map
exactly from `name` value and `array`, `object` and `string` JSON types MUST be injected string encoded.

==== Output File metadata
There is often a need by the processing system to capture additional job extracted metadata on output files. The Seed
standard allows for this through the use of side-car files. The side-car files must be named exactly as the file they
describe, with the addition of the `.metadata.json` extension to the original file name (extension included). The file
must be formatted according to the link:schema/seed.metadata.schema.json[Seed Metadata Schema]. This allows for both
spatial and temporal metadata to be specified.

The following snippet demonstrates the optional values that may be specified:

[source,javascript]
.Metadata JSON
----
{
    "geometry": { <1>
        "type": "Polygon",
	    "coordinates": [
	        [ [ 100.0, 0.0 ], [ 101.0, 0.0 ], [ 101.0, 1.0 ], [ 100.0, 1.0 ], [ 100.0, 0.0 ] ]
        ]
    },
    "time": { <2>
        "start": "2016-08-06T00:00:00.000Z", <3>
        "end": "2016-08-06T00:00:00.000Z" <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Optional GeoJSON Geometry object defining spatial extent of file.
<2> Optional Time object defining temporal extent of file.
<3> Required string containing an ISO 8601 date indicating the start temporal extent of file. String must include full
time down to minute precision.
<3> Required string containing an ISO 8601 date indicating the end temporal extent of file. String must include full
time down to minute precision. If the data is a single point-in-time the end date should match the start date.

=== Examples
The Seed standard is intended to support both simple and complex job packaging. To that end the standard allows for
sensible defaults to take the place of a fully specified manifest. The following examples identify both a minimal
Seed use and a more realistic, fully exercised standard.

==== Random Number Generator Job

== Discovery
A primary intention of this standard is for simple job discovery from public images hosted within either Docker Hub,
Docker Trusted Registry or Docker Registry. There is significant fragmentation of APIs between the various Docker
offerings and the following sections describe the steps that may be taken to access the labels defined by Seed.

None of the Docker registry services support label search in any fashion. This incurs the requirement of applying a
secondary means to subset image results. The standard presently requires that all job image are named with the suffix
`-seed`. This allows for quick filtering of results to a manageable set for discovery.

=== Docker Hub
Docker Hub stores Docker image manifest information in a readily accessible format only for Automated Builds. This
enforces the need for all developers wishing to support simple discovery from Docker Hub to support Hub builds, as
opposed to local image builds followed by a docker push. Given this caveat, a service such as ImageLayers can be used
to quickly identify manifest content after discovering available images.

The following two steps may be taken to find and identify labels within Docker Hub:

* Perform HTTP GET to find Docker images:
** URL: https://hub.docker.com/v2/search/repositories/?query=-seed
* Perform HTTP POST to get label details for images found in previous request:
** BODY: {"repos":[{"name":"myorg/myjob-seed","tag":"latest"}]}
** URL: https://imagelayers.io/registry/analyze

The ImageLayers service is a 3rd-party service by CenturyLink Labs, but the source code is openly available at
https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/imagelayers[ImageLayers] and can be used as a reference implementation.

=== Docker Registry
Docker Registry does not natively support any type of search, but does provide a catalog API that allows for listing the
entire registry contents. Using this along with tag and manifest inspection will allow label inspection.

The following steps may be taken to find and identify labels of Seed compliant images within Docker Registry:

NOTE: All references to `{registry}`, `{image-id}` and `{tag}` in the following URLs should be replaced with your
environment specific values.

* Perform HTTP GET against catalog endpoint to find `-seed` suffixed images:
** URL: http://{registry}/v2/_catalog
* Perform HTTP GET against tags endpoint for each image matched:
** http://{registry}/v2/{image-id}/tags/list
* Perform HTTP GET against manifests endpoint to retrieve labels per tag (extract labels from history JSON member):
** http://{registry}/v2/{image-id}/manifests/{tag}

=== Docker Trusted Registry
There is a ticket in with Docker Trusted Registry team to natively support label search. Presently there is no API
support to inspect hosted images for label metadata. Images must be pulled locally for inspection.

== Schema
The following JSON Schema should be used to validate Seed manifests prior to label serialization into a Dockerfile
for publish. It may be downloaded here: link:schema/seed.manifest.schema.json[Seed Manifest Schema]
